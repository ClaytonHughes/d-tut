GUI
===

How would you do a cross-platform GUI in D?

There is `DWT <https://github.com/d-widget-toolkit/dwt>`_,
a pure D framework,
which ports the Java SWT API.

Then there are bindings to other frameworks
like `GTK+ <https://github.com/gtkd-developers/GtkD>`_ or
`Qt <https://bitbucket.org/qtd/repo>`_.
