Philosophy
==========

To describe D in one sentence:

   D is what C++ wanted to be.

The `D Website <http://dlang.org/index.html>`_
proclaims (and then elaborates):

   Modern convenience. Modeling power. Native efficiency.

Critique
--------

Sometimes D is criticised,
because it is not *simple* language,
in contrast to Go, Rust, Lisp, or Scala.
However, a D programmer sees no problem
and actually likes his big toolbox.

   It's like a professional handyman having the smallest possible possible
   toolbox with only the barest essentials, versus a big super-toolbox that
   has all the *right* tools he might need. Just because it's there doesn't
   mean it has to be used, but if I were a handyman and had to remove a
   phillips-head screw, I'd want to be able to reach for a forward/reverse
   drill and an appropriately-sized phillips-head bit, and not have to pry it
   out with the bare minimum (the back of a hammer, or a
   sort-of-sized-similarly manual flathead screwdriver), and also not have to
   put one specialized mini-toolbox back and switch to a
   differently-specialized mini-toolbox for every different task.

D targets programmers,
who write code every day.
Learning that big toolbox pays off quite quickly in this scenario.
If you only occasionally write short one-off programs,
then D might not be the right tool for you.

Nevertheless the size is not a design goal of D as a language.

   We want a comprehensive language, not a big/complex/perfect one.
