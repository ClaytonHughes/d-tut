Welcome to the D Tutorial
======================================

This is an introduction to the
`D Programming Language <http://dlang.org/>`_.

Audience
--------

While the goal is to be generic,
there are a few assumptions about you, the reader.

* You can program already.
  This is not a general tutorial to learn programming.
  You should know the basics like
  variables, if-statements, and functions.

* You can use a command line interface.
  This tutorial covers compilation from raw compiler invocations.
  Using an IDE would hide this build process.
  Since I am using Linux,
  examples will assume a bash shell,
  which is the default on all major distributions (including BSD and OS X).

* You also read the `official D website <http://dlang.org/>`_.
  It contains a lot of good information.
  While some info is certainly repeated here for convenience,
  in lots of places this tutorial just provides links.
